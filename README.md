The React JS Drag and Drop GitHub repo is a code repository containing a project for building a drag-and-drop interface using React. This project demonstrates how to create a drag-and-drop functionality by using the react-dnd library, which provides a set of React components and utilities for building a drag-and-drop interface. The repo provides an example of how to use this library to create a simple drag-and-drop interface that allows users to move items from one list to another. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to implement drag-and-drop functionality in a React application.
